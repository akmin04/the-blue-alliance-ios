Hey yâ€™all - this update introduces a new Team@Event view!

This update also fixes a bug where myTBA cells wouldn't update properly, fixes a bug where off season events on the first of the month wouldn't show up in the events list, fixes showing incorrect precision for 2015 data, and fixes a crash when singing out of myTBA.
